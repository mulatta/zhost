# xotero roadmap

This file holds what comes next. `DESIGN.md` describes what exists today.

## Product direction

1. Inventory and specify the upstream Zotero API layers.
2. Build the xotero server first, including multi-user, groups, roles, and
   library-scoped permissions.
3. Evolve and optimize PostgreSQL storage through explicit migrations.
4. Use pinned upstream Web Library as the only client. Desktop support and any
   dedicated or custom client are out of scope.
5. Enter beta when Web Library works end to end, then harden multi-user operation.
6. Use release candidates to stabilize the server and Web Library together.

## Compatibility promise

The final target is the complete **public** Zotero API, delivered in versioned
compatibility profiles. Internal Zotero.org operations and production
infrastructure are not part of that promise.

A supported endpoint must match upstream behavior in:

- HTTP method and path;
- authentication and authorization;
- request and response JSON;
- required and exposed headers;
- pagination and filtering;
- library and object version semantics;
- conditional reads and writes;
- group and role permissions;
- file registration, upload, and download;
- error status and retry behavior;
- documented output formats.

Partial endpoint compatibility is not sufficient. Unsupported endpoints and
formats must fail explicitly rather than return a plausible but incompatible
shape.

### Sources of truth

Compatibility work uses these sources, in order, with conflicts recorded:

1. Versioned public Zotero Web API documentation
2. Requests made by pinned upstream `zotero/web-library`
3. Upstream `zotero/dataserver` controllers, models, and tests
4. Existing xotero behavior, only where it does not conflict with upstream

The `dataserver` source defines many edge cases not described in public docs. Its
MySQL schema, sharding, caches, queues, billing, and operational services do not
constrain xotero internals.

## API compatibility profiles

### Profile A: Sync and Data Core

Required before alpha:

- API keys and current-key introspection
- OIDC-backed browser sessions
- Browser-approved login sessions that issue user-owned API keys
- Users and personal libraries
- Groups, memberships, and upstream role semantics
- Items, collections, saved searches, tags, and settings
- Deleted-object feeds
- Full-text synchronization
- Attachment registration, upload, replacement, and download
- Library and object versions
- Conditional reads and writes
- Pagination, sorting, filtering, and documented query behavior
- Personal and group library route families
- Read, write, notes, and file permissions

Profile A is sufficient for Web Library and core Web API consumers. It must
support multiple users and private groups before alpha, even though multi-user
production hardening continues during beta.

### Profile B: Public API Completeness

Implemented incrementally during alpha and beta, and required for the eventual
public-API-complete release:

- Single-object and child-object endpoints
- Trash and publications behavior
- Public user and group access where documented
- Group metadata and membership management APIs
- All documented item and collection query variants
- Documented export representations and content negotiation
- Citation and bibliography output formats
- Remaining public key and permission management behavior
- Other endpoints confirmed as part of the public Zotero API inventory

The inventory in `checks/contracts`, not this summary, is the authoritative
checklist.

### Profile C: xotero ecosystem APIs

xotero-specific APIs use a separate namespace and never alter upstream paths:

```text
/xotero/capabilities
/xotero/admin/...
/xotero/agents/...
```

Potential Profile C features:

- Instance administration
- Agent-safe search and write workflows
- Device and agent pairing
- Health, readiness, and diagnostics
- Client capability discovery

## Client strategy

### Web Library

Pinned upstream `zotero/web-library` is the only supported client. It runs
same-origin through a session-bound gateway, with no custom Web client and no
hosted Zotero service dependency.

## Agent integration

Agents use the same public API as any other consumer. Provider credentials stay
inside native agent runtimes.

```text
Agent runtime -> xotero tool adapter -> xotero API
```

Initial safe tools:

- search library objects;
- retrieve item metadata;
- retrieve attachment text;
- list collections and related items;
- draft and create notes;
- propose and apply tags;
- create item relations;
- render citations when supported.

Read operations may be automatic. Writes require scoped credentials and an
explicit approval policy. Coding-agent filesystem and shell tools are not
implicitly exposed.

Common implementations may include a machine-readable `xoteroctl` CLI and agent
tool adapters.

## Release train

### Pre-alpha: server compatibility construction

Pre-alpha is for rapid server development and may break schema and configuration.
It is not a production-security claim.

Deliverables:

- Complete public API inventory and compatibility profiles
- Multi-user relational identity foundation and OIDC identity mapping
- User-owned and scoped API keys
- Personal libraries, private groups, memberships, and roles
- Profile A user and group endpoints
- Library-scoped PostgreSQL and S3 operations
- Packaged upstream Web Library and a real browser gate
- Initial backup and migration tooling

Exit criteria for alpha:

- Profile A inventory is complete and implemented.
- Two users have isolated personal libraries.
- Two users can collaborate in one private group library.
- Owner/admin/member behavior matches captured upstream contracts.
- Metadata, files, full text, conflicts, and deletions pass Web Library E2E tests.
- Cross-user and cross-library access tests fail closed.
- A documented migration exists from the single-user schema and storage.

### Alpha: API stabilization

Alpha starts when Profile A server behavior works end to end. APIs may still
change, but changes require compatibility notes and migrations.

Deliverables:

- Versioned Profile A contract suite
- Progressive Profile B implementation
- Agent tool protocol and `xoteroctl`
- Health and readiness endpoints
- Documented backup, restore, and key rotation
- NixOS deployment and initial OCI/Compose paths

Exit criteria for beta:

- Web Library passes the server contract suite.
- Supported alpha upgrades preserve metadata and files.
- Remaining multi-user risks have explicit beta hardening tests.

### Beta: multi-user hardening

Beta treats existing multi-user functionality as a production-bound security and
concurrency surface.

Deliverables:

- OIDC provisioning and account-linking hardening
- API-key creation, revocation, rotation, and audit behavior
- Group membership and role-transition hardening
- Concurrent write and version-conflict tests
- Cross-library object, file, and pre-signed URL isolation tests
- Abuse limits and bounded resource usage
- Larger realistic data and group workloads
- Backup and restore drills across multiple users and groups
- Continued Profile B completion

Stable-beta gate:

- No known cross-user or cross-library isolation failure.
- Role matrix and key-permission matrix have complete integration coverage.
- Multi-device and multi-user conflict behavior matches upstream.
- Migration and restore tests cover all supported beta releases.
- One deployment can be operated without undocumented manual database changes.

### Release candidates: client convergence

Release candidates freeze declared API profiles and stabilize all supported
client surfaces.

Deliverables:

- Web Library compatibility matrix
- Browser session and attachment CORS hardening
- Accessibility and localization pass
- NixOS, OCI, and Compose release artifacts
- Upgrade, backup, restore, and disaster-recovery documentation
- Security review and release threat model

Exit criteria for 1.0:

- Declared compatibility profiles are complete and versioned.
- Web Library passes release E2E suites.
- Supported upgrades preserve all user, group, metadata, full-text, and file
  data.
- Authentication, authorization, and browser boundaries have no known critical
  defects.
- Deployment and recovery can be reproduced from public documentation.

- [ ] 40. Reconcile local guidance and release ledger
  - Acceptance: Direct agent prose review against actual commands/outputs; `git diff --cached --name-only` has no docs/plans/AGENTS, and read-only `git status --short` accounts for every path.
### Final audits

- [ ] F1. Plan compliance audit
- [ ] F2. Code quality review
- [ ] F3. Real manual QA
- [ ] F4. Ideal-state fidelity

## Technical debt

- **P0** blocks safe multi-user work or can violate data or security invariants.
- **P1** blocks an alpha-quality operational or compatibility claim.
- **P2** should be addressed before a stable release.

### P0: immediate cleanup

- [ ] Make README status text agree with the current multi-user server.

### P1: schema and migrations

- [ ] Document backup-before-upgrade and rollback-by-restore procedures.
- [ ] Add an explicit `xotero migrate` operational path. Plan Task 33.
- [ ] Audit `IF NOT EXISTS` migration statements that can conceal schema drift.
- [ ] Update stale migration comments, including the old filesystem description
  for S3-backed file bytes.

### P1: HTTP and compatibility structure

- [ ] Centralize Zotero error, version-header, pagination, and conditional-write
  responses so handlers cannot silently omit contract details.
- [ ] Separate current verified behavior in `xotero/SPEC.md` from target support.
- [ ] Inventory API-version, schema-version, content-negotiation, conditional
  request, pagination, and output-format edge cases. Plan Task 22.
- [ ] Add a trusted-proxy configuration. The server now requires a loopback bind,
  but it has no separate proxy setting. Plan Task 31.

### P1: operations

- [ ] Handle `SIGTERM` as a graceful shutdown signal and verify in the NixOS
  service test. Only `ctrl_c` is handled today. Plan Task 35.
- [ ] Add liveness and readiness endpoints with documented PostgreSQL and object
  storage semantics. Plan Task 36.
- [ ] Configure database pool, request, S3, and shutdown timeouts. Upload
  timeouts exist. Pool and shutdown timeouts do not. Plan Task 35.
- [ ] Add request concurrency limits. Upload limits exist. _unmerged_
- [ ] Exercise backup and restore for metadata, full text, and attachment bytes.
  Plan Task 37.

### P1: test and quality gates

- [ ] Add a real browser gate for upstream Web Library. Direct HTTP integration
  tests are not a client-compatibility substitute. Plan Task 32.
- [ ] Confirm two-user, two-library, same-object-key isolation coverage.
- [ ] Add backup and restore tests. Plan Task 37.
- [ ] Run Clippy and dependency advisory/license checks in CI. Formatting, unit
  tests, and individual NixOS checks already run.
- [ ] Replace `minio-client` in `nixos-sync`. The current nixpkgs update refuses
  to evaluate it as insecure, which blocks dependency PR #23.

### P2: dependencies and abstractions

- [ ] Compare `rust-s3`, `aws-sdk-s3`, OpenDAL, and `object_store` against R2 and
  RustFS with presigning and streaming tests. `rust-s3 0.38` already removed the
  old Hyper 0.14 stack from the lockfile.
- [ ] Evaluate SQLx 0.9 in an isolated dependency change. Do not combine it with
  identity schema or authorization refactors.
- [ ] Introduce a narrow object-storage trait when attachment tests can define
  its required semantics; do not create a generic storage framework first.
- [ ] Keep pure deterministic domain logic portable, but add `wasm-bindgen` only
  after a custom client demonstrates enough shared logic to justify the boundary.
- [ ] Consider gRPC only for a future independently deployed native service with
  a concrete bidirectional-streaming or generated-client requirement.
