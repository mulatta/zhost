# xotero design

This file describes the system as it exists. Plans belong in `ROADMAP.md`, the
wire contract belongs in `API.md`, and the reasons for accepted decisions belong
in `adr/`.

Sections marked _unmerged_ describe implemented work that is not in `main` yet.

## Purpose

xotero is a self-hosted, multi-user server for the public Zotero Web API. It
follows Zotero's HTTP contract and keeps a smaller storage and deployment
architecture than Zotero's `dataserver`. `dataserver` is a behavioral reference,
not an architecture to reproduce.

## Deployment model

One deployment is one tenant, and it contains many users, personal libraries, and
group libraries. There is no application-level `tenant_id`. Isolation between
deployments comes from separate xotero, PostgreSQL, object storage, and identity
provider configuration.

```text
browser or API client
    -> trusted reverse proxy (OIDC)
    -> xotero on a loopback address
    -> PostgreSQL (metadata and state)
    -> S3-compatible object store (attachment bytes)
```

## Identity and authentication

OIDC stays at the reverse proxy. The server maps verified `(issuer, subject)`
claims to a local user, and email is never an identity key. The server requires a
loopback bind address because the proxy is the only party allowed to set identity
headers.

Three paths issue or carry credentials:

- `Zotero-API-Key` carries a database-backed key that is hashed, owned by a user,
  scoped, and revocable. Configured recovery credentials are hashed and validated
  at startup.
- Web sessions use a server-side session with a CSRF header `x-xotero-csrf`.
  Mutations must present it. _unmerged_

- `/keys/sessions` and `/login` run a browser-approved login session. After OIDC
  approval, the server issues a user-owned API key derived with
  `loginKdfKeyFile`.

Instance administrators are explicit records, and bootstrap runs once.

## Authorization

Every authenticated request resolves to one `RequestContext` before a handler
touches data. The context holds the principal, the library, and the permissions.
`/users/<id>/...` and `/groups/<id>/...` resolve to a library, and then share data
handlers. URL identifiers, object keys, and file keys never bypass this context.

Requests are authorized before the server reads their bodies. Lookup failures
return an error and never fall back to a permissive default.

Group roles are owner, admin, and member. Group lifecycle, membership, and
ownership transitions live under `/xotero/...`. _unmerged_

## Data model

Items, collections, searches, and settings stay canonical JSONB objects. This
preserves unknown upstream fields and supports object-level sync. An indexed
projection must be derivable from canonical data or have a documented rebuild
path.

Security and ownership data is relational, so constraints and transactions
enforce it:

- identity: `users`, `external_identities`, `instance_admins`, `bootstrap_state`
- credentials: `api_keys`, `api_key_user_permissions`,
  `api_key_group_permissions`, `api_key_all_groups_permissions`
- libraries: `library`, `personal_libraries`, `groups`, `group_memberships`,
  `storage_policy`
- sessions: `login_sessions`, `web_sessions`, `web_challenges`
- audit: `audit_events`

## Attachments

Bytes live in object storage. `file` rows hold the current pointer, and
`pending_uploads` holds in-flight upload state in PostgreSQL so restarts do not
lose it. New blobs use `libraries/<library-id>/uploads/<upload-token>` keys. Blobs
from the original single-user library keep their legacy bare keys.

Registration rechecks the original upload authority inside the transaction.

Removed blobs enter `blob_retirements`, so issued pre-signed URLs can expire
before deletion. Uploads stream through bounded hashing with concurrency, size,
and time limits. _unmerged_

## Migrations

- Every schema change is an ordered migration. Merged migrations are not edited.
- Tests start from realistic previous schemas and data.
- Performance normalization happens only from measured query or integrity needs.
- The server runs migrations at startup today. An explicit command is planned.

## Not reproduced from upstream

Zotero.org internal administration, billing, MySQL sharding, Redis, Memcached,
Elasticsearch, SQS, SNS, StatsD, Scribe, TTS, translation services, and the
Zotero.org website. A public endpoint that depends on one of these still needs a
smaller local implementation.
